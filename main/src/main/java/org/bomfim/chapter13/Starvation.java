    // --- RaciocÃ­nio (Reasoning) ---
    // 1. Shared Resource: We use a ReentrantLock as the shared resource.
    // 2. Non-Fair Lock: Crucially, 'false' in `new ReentrantLock(false)` makes the lock *non-fair*.
    //    A non-fair lock doesn't guarantee FIFO access. It allows threads that
    //    just released the lock (or new contenders) to "jump the queue" and re-acquire it.
    // 3. Two Competing Threads: "GreedyWorker" and "StarvedWorker".
    // 4. Constant Contention: Both threads repeatedly try to acquire the same lock.
    //    Because the lock is non-fair, the JVM's scheduler might consistently favor
    //    one thread (the "greedy" one) over the other (the "starved" one) when
    //    the lock becomes available. The "greedy" thread often re-acquires immediately.
    // 5. Observation: We count how many times each thread successfully acquires the lock.
    //    You will typically see the "StarvedWorker" acquiring the lock significantly
    //    fewer times, even though both tried the same number of times.
